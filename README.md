This project is a simple, interactive web-based tab interface that allows users to switch between different sections (Home, Blog, Shop, and Details) by clicking on tabs. The tabs dynamically display content when selected, and the active tab is visually highlighted.

Key Features:
Tab Navigation: Users can switch between different content sections (Home, Blog, Shop, and Details) by clicking on the tabs. The content corresponding to the selected tab is revealed with a smooth fade-in animation.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: A button allows users to switch between dark and light themes for the entire page, with the button text changing dynamically based on the current theme ("Dark Mode" to "Light Mode").
CSS Animations: The content transition between tabs is animated for a smoother, more engaging user experience. The tab names also have a subtle font-size animation for added visual feedback.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring the page looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
This project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and user-friendly interface, providing an excellent example of how to build interactive and visually appealing web elements.
